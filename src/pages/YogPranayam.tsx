            Yog Pranayam, the ancient art of conscious breath regulation, is one
            of the most powerful disciplines in the yogic tradition. ‚ÄúPrana‚Äù
            means vital life force, the subtle energy that animates body and
            mind, while ‚ÄúAyam‚Äù means expansion or control. Together, Pranayam is
            the science of expanding, balancing, and mastering life energy
            through the gateway of breath.
          </p>
          <p>
            For millennia, yogis have recognized that the quality of our breath
            shapes the quality of our mind. When breath is shallow and erratic,
            the mind is restless and clouded. When breath is deep and rhythmic,
            the mind becomes clear and serene. Pranayam harnesses this intimate
            connection to unlock physical vitality, mental clarity, and
            spiritual awareness.

          Philosophy & Yogic Vision
        </h2>
        <div className="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 space-y-4">
          <p>
            The yogic texts describe prana as the bridge between body and mind,
            matter and spirit. While food nourishes the body, prana nourishes
            consciousness itself. According to the Upanishads, ‚ÄúWhen prana
            departs, consciousness departs.‚Äù Thus, mastery over prana is
            regarded as mastery over life.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Patanjali‚Äôs Ashtanga Yoga, Pranayam is the fourth limb ‚Äî placed
            after Asana (posture) and before Pratyahara (sense withdrawal).
            Philosophically, it represents the turning point of yoga practice:
            moving from external discipline to internal mastery. By refining the
            flow of breath, one refines the flow of thought and begins to
            prepare for meditation and Samadhi.
          </p>
          <p>
            The yogis also described subtle energy channels called nadis. When
            the nadis are purified through Pranayam, energy flows freely, and
            higher states of awareness become natural. In this way, breath
            becomes the key to awakening dormant spiritual potential.

          Practice & Techniques
        </h2>
        <div className="leading-relaxed text-gray-700 space-y-4">
          <p>
            Yog Pranayam offers a wide spectrum of techniques, each with unique
            effects. Beginners often start with deep diaphragmatic breathing to
            increase lung capacity and calm the nervous system. From there, one
            progresses into structured practices such as:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>
              <b>Anulom Vilom (Alternate Nostril Breathing):</b> Balances the
              left and right hemispheres of the brain, harmonizing logic and
              intuition.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Kapalabhati (Skull-Shining Breath):</b> A dynamic technique
              that cleanses the respiratory system and energizes the body.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Bhramari (Bee Breath):</b> Produces a humming sound that soothes
              the mind and relieves stress.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Ujjayi (Victorious Breath):</b> Generates internal heat,
              purifies energy channels, and enhances focus.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each technique requires mindful practice under guidance. Pranayam is
            not merely a breathing exercise ‚Äî it is an energetic art that
            affects body chemistry, nervous system, and subtle consciousness.
            Regular practice gradually transforms health, emotions, and inner
            perception.
