            Sakshi trains the mind to observe without attachment. By witnessing thoughts and emotions 
            without identification, one cultivates clarity, presence, and inner freedom.

      {/* Introduction */}
      <section className="py-12 bg-white prose max-w-4xl mx-auto container-padding">
        <p>
          Sakshi, the witness consciousness, is a central practice in Vedantic meditation. 
          It enables the practitioner to step back from mental turbulence and recognize the 
          transient nature of thoughts and emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through Sakshi, awareness deepens, and the mind begins to perceive the subtle layers 
          of experience. One realizes that the self is not the mind, but the observer of the mind. 
          This insight fosters detachment, peace, and stability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regular practice of Sakshi helps break habitual reactivity. Stressful situations are 
          met with presence, anger dissolves into understanding, and decisions arise from clarity 
          rather than impulse.

        <p>
          Sakshi is not merely observation, but a transformation of consciousness. As the 
          witness, the mind no longer clings to experiences but appreciates them fully. 
          Emotional intelligence grows, relationships deepen, and life unfolds with clarity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more one practices Sakshi, the more subtle layers of consciousness are 
          revealed. This leads to an inner serenity that is unaffected by external circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, Sakshi connects the practitioner to the timeless awareness at the 
          heart of all existence â€” calm, clear, and radiant.
